## A fridge management app
#####by Darrell Griffin, Hang Tran, & Tianna McClanahan

The leftOvers app will allow users to keep an inventory of the contents of their fridge.  Each item will contain details such as the expiration date and other valuable data to assist the user in maintaining an organized fridge. The app will also access an API which will provide recipes based on the contents of the user's fridge.
